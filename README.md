Hi and thanks for downloading my program.
Its main function is searching for empty folders.
And that's all, but I'm still working on it.

Hi and welcome, also thanks for downloading this program.
To start somewhere, let me begin with functionality.
So, there are three main searches.

Searching for empty Directories
As may name already tells, its purpose is finding empty Directories and saving their locations.
This was the first and the most important function I wrote, because I used it to build other ones.

Searching for empty files
Yup, also name tells more-less everything you have to know.
This function search empty files (files where is nothing in it) and save their location.

Searching for duplicates
This one find all duplicates you have. Well, I would like to say it, but that's not true in all cases.
This function looks for files, that have the same size and type. Soo, thanks to this, if it'll find two files with same size and type, it saves them as duplicates, but they may not be really duplicates. Nevertheless it works in a most of cases.

How does it returns outcome?
Program will ask you, if you want to print it or save in file(oucome.txt -> in nolder/).

Is it safe to use?
Yup.

Do you have some problems with program? or Do you have ideas what shout be changed, modified, added?
